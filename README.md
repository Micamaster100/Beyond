# **MEGA NOTE**:
Roblox released [Byfron](https://byfron.com/) recently and if any 3rd-party softwares are detected, you may end up in a ban. Unless WeAreDevs changes their API, using Beyond may be risky to use and if you get banned, that's your problem, not mine...
Also this executor pretty much sucks ass, and you should just use Synapse X.

# Beyond
Source code of Beyond, the Roblox script executor.
# Notes:
- All of this is open-source, but only works with Windows at the moment. Winforms C# .NET Framework
- This is the source code. Also where the latest updates are. There's some useless files here, however. More than not, the soruce code is for modifying and having your own spinoff.
- WeAreDevs API was used.

# Instructions:
## Installation
1. Disable antivirus.
2. Download the file from the code button.
3. Extract the file using WinZip, or your OS may be able to do it for you. I'd recommend that you extract it to a folder.
4. In the File Explorer, go to Beyond > Beyond > Bin > Beyond.exe
5. It should work properly.
## Exploiting
1. Inject Beyond into Roblox. You may see a terminal appear on your screen. It shouldn't take any more than 10 seconds.
2. Find a script from a trusted source on the internet. If you're new, check out the **ScriptHub** button. Automatically executes on click.
3. Press **Execute** to run the script. You dont have to press **Execute** if you used **ScriptHub**. (no pressure buddy)
# Errors
> Exploit is patched. _Blah, blah, blah_

Unfortunately, Beyond is patched at the moment. It should happen every wednesday. The API should be back up in a couple of hours. In the meantime, go touch some grass.
> Roblox is not open.

Exploit does not detect Roblox being open. If not already, open Roblox.
For the time being, Beyond doesn't support Roblox downloaded from the Microsoft Store. Download it from the [Roblox Download Page](https://roblox.com/download).

> _Blah, blah, blah..._ Did the dll properly inject?

Seems like you probably forgot to **Inject** Beyond into Roblox. Simply press **Inject** and the script should run.
